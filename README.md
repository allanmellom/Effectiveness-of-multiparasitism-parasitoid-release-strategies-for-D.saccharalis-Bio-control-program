Effectiveness of multiparasitism and parasitoid release strategies for Sugarcane borer, Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) biological control programs


Description
The simulations of this mathemtical modelling is part of the dissertation of Allan Mello de Macedo (http://lattes.cnpq.br/5949499855105131) with the advisor of Dra. Carolina Reigada (http://lattes.cnpq.br/5171685489598372) in the Post-Graduate Program of Ecology and Natural Resources (PPGERN-UFSCar) and was published with the help of Alexandre Diniz (http://lattes.cnpq.br/8692537346607552) e Juliana de Oliveira (#TO-DO: por nome e link deles: Juliana Santos de Oliveira) in the Paper 'Effectiveness of multiparasitism and parasitoid release strategies for Sugarcane borer,Diatraea saccharalis (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) biological control programs'.

The simulations function runing the 'Simulations.py' file. It requires Python, as well some external library, named 'pickle', and some Python internal libraries, like 'random', 'math' and 'os'. To run the simulations simply run said file with Python and it will do all the necessary functions by itself, if external libraries are already installed.
During the simulations six different folders are created to separete all scenarios simulated.
After the end of the simulation inside each folder going to be a read_me.txt file (on what is, how each file is written and how to read them) and 9 .py files for each replicate.
All file is written as an Object Serialization with Pickle, so to read the files is necessary to use Pickle Module (https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).
